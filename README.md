# phptodosymfony

I am a simple ToDo application built using the Symfony framework.

## Objective
This application was developed to use the phptodo application classes without any changes so it focuses on the Symfony front controller part of the application only. See this repo for the original classes: https://github.com/johnfallen/phptodo

Changes to the original classes namespaces were necessary.
